.SH SYNOPSIS
stroke-text [options] [input files] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIStroke-text\fP renders stroked text to gcode, using glyphs
originally derived from the Hershey fonts. Each line of text is
rendered to separate rectangle, where rectangles may be defined
using a gcode template or parametrically on the command line.
.PP
The source text may come from text files or from command line
arguments.

Defines the starting X location for parametrically generated boxes.
.TP
.BI "-y,--start-y " start-y
Defines the starting Y location for parametrically generated boxes.
.TP
.BI "-w,--width " width
Defines the width for parametrically generated boxes.
.TP
.BI "-h,--height " height
Defines the height for parametrically generated boxes.
.TP
.BI "-X,--delta-x " delta-x
Defines the X offset between parametrically generated boxes.
.TP
.BI "-Y,--delta-y " delta-y
Defines the Y offset between parametrically generated boxes.
.TP
.BI "-c,--columns " columns
Defines the number of columns of parametrically generated boxes.
.TP
.BI "-v,--value " value
Sets an initial numeric value for generated text.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Draw "hello world" into a 4"x1" box at 1"x1"
.nf
$ stroke-text -o output.gcode -T "hello world" -w 4 -h 1 -x 1 -y 1
.fi
.PP
Draw numbers starting at 1 using the sample template
.nf
$ stroke-text -o output.gcode -v 1 -t template
.fi
.PP
Draw 10 numbers from 10232 to 10241 in a 2x5 grid of 0.25"x0.1" boxes
spaced 4"x1.5" apart and offset by 1.5"x1" from the origin with a
border of 0.01" around the text:
.nf
$ stroke-text -o output.gcode -v 10232 -n 10 -c 2 -x 1.5 -y 1 -w .25 -h .1 -X 4 -Y 1.5 -b 0.01
